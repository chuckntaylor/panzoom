# Panzoom

This is simply a build of the npm **[@panzoom/panzoom](https://github.com/timmywil/panzoom)** package by **[timmywil](https://github.com/timmywil)**

This build adds in the code found in the comments of issue **[#512](https://github.com/timmywil/panzoom/issues/512)**. This solves a bug where pinch zooming wide images, causes it to move away from screen center.

This build simply exists so that I can include it in my project while I await it being fully incorporated into the next release.

## Dependency in package.json

```json
"@panzoom/panzoom": "git+https://github.com/chuckntaylor/panzoom.git"
```
